# Apple Picker

## Instructions

Create a method, `apple_picker`, that will pick all the apples out of an array. Implement this only using `each`.

```ruby
apple_picker(["apple", "orange", "apple"]) #=> ["apple", "apple"]
```

## Challenge
Implement it with `collect` and then implement it with `select`. Write a sentence about how `select` differs from `collect`.



# Holiday Suppliers

You have a bunch of decorations for various holidays organized by season.

```ruby
holiday_supplies = {
  :winter => {
    :christmas => ["Lights", "Wreath"],
    :new_years => ["Party Hats"]
  },
  :summer => {
    :forth_of_july => ["Fireworks", "BBQ"]
  },
  :fall => {
    :thanksgiving => ["Turkey"]
  },
  :spring => {
    :memorial_day => ["BBQ"]
  }
