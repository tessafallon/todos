# Let's make an object that behaves like a hash today!
 
# I'd like to be able to find keys in the hash regardless of whether they are strings or symbols.
 
# For example
 
# obj = {:blake => "the best"}
# obj["blake"] #=> "the best"
 
# I'd like to be able to set values in our fake hash.
# I'd like to be able to find all values that have keys beginning with the letter a.
# I'd like to be able to get all the keys in the hash in a descending alphabetized array.
